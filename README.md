Understanding the present solution

Since any external module could not be used I was doubtful about using the date/time modules, for which i did not use it. Instead I created the 'sexa_2_dec' and the 'wrkd_hours' functions in order to compare the times in decimal means and then calulate the worked hours by substraction.

After that I created the 'tms_by_day' function where the hours and payments are assigned.
